# Stealth-Flip : Advanced Steganography Tool with Encryption
# Steath-Flip is an advanced steganography tool that allows you to hide files inside images using pixel manipulation. It also provides an additional layer of encryption using AES-256 for secure data hiding and extraction. The image is altered in a way that it remains visually unchanged to the human eye but contains secret information.

## Features
- Hide any file inside PNG, BMP, TIFF, or TGA images.
- Extract hidden files from carrier images.
- AES-256 encryption for secure file storage.
- Passphrase authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
- Image transformation (e.g., negative) for additional obfuscation.
- Compression of files before embedding to optimize space usage.
  
## Prerequisites
